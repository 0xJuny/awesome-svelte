1. Fork the repo.
2. Add your project to `README.md` in the most appropriate field. Make sure the description starts with an uppercase character and ends with a period. This is the format:
`- [Project Name](Project URL) - A sentence that describes your project and what makes it different from others.`
3. If you cannot think of an appropriate field, open an issue.
4. Describe in at least one sentence why you think the project is awesome.
5. Make a PR.
6. Maybe take a nap.
